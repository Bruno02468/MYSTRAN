## 15.2.0 (2024/4/7)

This update implements a significant improvement to the RBE3 element 
(which would hardly be possible without the invaluable assistance we 
got from Victor from the MecWay project), a TUBE2 option for PBARL 
props, and adds grid point forces in OP2 output.

Added:
 - [Adding TUBE2 option to PBARL](https://github.com/MYSTRANsolver/MYSTRAN/pull/40)
 - [Adding GPFORCE op2 writing to Mystran](https://github.com/MYSTRANsolver/MYSTRAN/pull/55)

Fixed:
 - [The RBE3 Fix](https://github.com/MYSTRANsolver/MYSTRAN/pull/59)
